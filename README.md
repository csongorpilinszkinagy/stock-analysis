# Stock analysis

My goal is to assemble a portfolio that can **10x in a decade**.
```math
\sqrt[10]{10} = 1,2589254118
```
That means an **average CAGR of 25%** which would be a pretty impressive performance.

Since the global economy is only growing at around 3% this rate this may seems unsustainable. However during paradigm changes disruptive companies can vastly outperform any index. These take shape in S-curves as innovators grow exponantially while incumbents struggle and face rapid decay. Given a long enough timeframe (multi decade) and through "riding" these innovation S-curve growth waves I believe it is possible as a retail investor to achive such results.

## Exponential growth

We can examine the anatomy of exponential growth by studying price theory. For elastic products an incremental price improvement results in exponential increse in demand. Short term any product can be priced low, thus making it artificially desirable, but the challenging part is sustained price improvement over the competitors. This can only be achieved by optiization on the costs side, so by improving the efficiency of production.

On the other hand as Wrigth's law states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs will fall by a constant percentage. These together create a feedback loop that can result in a sustainable exponential growth, until the product saturates the market.

## Growth and company valuation

Since a company's intrinsic value is tied to it's performance, long term the company'y growth and valuation correlate. Short term the valuation of a company can greatly differ from it's intrinsic value, but eventually it should align itself with the true value. So in order to have 25% growth one should look at companies that can grow at least that rate for multiple years.

## Renewables

The last paradigm shift was the smartphone, right now renewables are on the rise. This means total electrification of production, storage and consumption of the energy sector. On the production and consumption side things are looking good, storage seems to be the current bottleneck. Solar, wind and batteries are a powerful trio that can replace the current energy market. As with any other disruption adoption takes place as an S-curve, where early adoption is slow. We are currently entering the rapid growth phase which presents multiple investment opportunities.

### Tesla
Tesla is the main contender in the renewables space. They are in the electric car, solar and storage business, just to name a few, all of which grow exponentially. Their car production target is 50% growth per year, which they are executing on perfectly so far. What makes their growth sustainable is their incredible pricing power which stems from their production efficiency. The margins are so high, that they can price their cars real-time to match demand to their ramping production rate. With the recent introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) their storage production has seen huge ramp up too. Their output should outperform even the 50% growth in car sales. They plan on reaching 20M production per year for the end of the decade, which means a sustainable exponential growth. All of these and much more make Tesla a perfect candidate for this portfolio.
