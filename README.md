# Stock analysis

My goal is to assemble a portfolio that can **10x in a decade**.
```math
\sqrt[10]{10} = 1,2589254118
```
That means an **average CAGR of 25%** which would be a pretty impressive return. Since the global economy is not growing at this rate this may seems unsustainable. However inside the global average there are thriving and failing companies, especially during paradigm changes. These take shape in S-curves as innovators grow exponantially while incumbents struggle and face inevitable decay. Given a long enough timeframe (multi decade) and through "riding" these innovation S-curve growth waves I believe it is possible as a retail investor to achive such results.
